## 🚀 Installation

### Method 1: Install from GitHub Releases (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Start the Backend Server
1. **Navigate to the backend folder:**
   - After extracting the ZIP file, you'll find two folders: `backend` and `extension`
   - Open a terminal/command prompt in the `backend` folder
2. **Install dependencies (if needed):**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - Keep this terminal window open - the backend server must be running for the extension to work
   - You should see a message indicating the server is running (typically on `http://localhost:5000`)

#### Step 2: Download and Extract the Extension
1. **Download the latest release:**
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/InflixOP/ContentSnap/releases)
   - Download `ContentSnap-v[version]-extension.zip`
   - Extract the ZIP file

#### Step 3: Install the Browser Extension
**For Chrome/Edge:**
- Open `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`)
- Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right)
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Select the `extension` folder (not the main ContentSnap folder)
- Pin the extension to your toolbar

**For Firefox:**
- Open `about:debugging`
- Click "This Firefox"
- Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
- Select `manifest.json` from the `extension` folder

#### Important Notes:
- **Backend must be running**: Always start the backend server (`python app.py`) before using the extension
- **Two folders**: The main ContentSnap folder contains both `backend` and `extension` folders
- **Select the right folder**: When loading the extension, select the `extension` folder, not the main ContentSnap folder

### Method 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/InflixOP/ContentSnap.git
cd ContentSnap

# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install

# Build the extension (if build process exists)
npm run build
